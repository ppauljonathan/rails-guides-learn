# Validations

Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved in your db
they are db agnostic, and therefore are easy to use, test, and maintain

- model-level
- db-level
- client-level
- controller-level

a model in rails is made using a class which is a subclass of `ApplicationRecord`, which inherits form `ActiveRecord:: Base`

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
end

# to add validations, we add validations when defining the Person model

class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :age, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }
end

p = Person.new
```

the object p viz an instance of Person is currently present in the scope of the program but has not yet been stored in the db

to do this, rails first uses `p.new_record?` method to find whether the object `p` is already present in the database or not, then when `p.save` is called, it checks the validations and if they pass, then saves the object to the db

`p.save` returns `false` if the validations fail
`p.save!` throws an error if the validations fail

- this is true for all the below methods, the bang methods throw error while the non-bang methods return false if validations fail

- The following methods trigger validations, and will save the object to the database only if the object is valid:

  - `create`
  - `create!`
  - `save`
  - `save!`
  - `update`
  - `update!`

- The following methods skip validations, and will save the object to the database regardless of its validity. They should be used with caution.

  - `decrement!`
  - `decrement_counter`
  - `increment!`
  - `increment_counter`
  - `insert`
  - `insert!`
  - `insert_all`
  - `insert_all!`
  - `toggle!`
  - `touch`
  - `touch_all`
  - `update_all`
  - `update_attribute`
  - `update_column`
  - `update_columns`
  - `update_counters`
  - `upsert`
  - `upsert_all`

Note that `save` also has the ability to skip validations if passed `validate:
false` as an argument. This technique should be used with caution.

```ruby
save(validate: false)
```

the preamble methods `.valid?` and `.invalid?` run the validations on the object

when an object of Person is created the validations are not run until rails attempts to save the object in the db at which point, validations are run and any errors are put in the instance variable, errors for p, which is a collection of errors

```bash
irb> p = Person.new
=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil>
irb> p.errors.size
=> 0

irb> p.valid?
=> false
irb> p.errors.objects.first.full_message
=> "Name can't be blank"

irb> p = Person.create
=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil>
irb> p.errors.objects.first.full_message
=> "Name can't be blank"

irb> p.save
=> false

irb> p.save!
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank

irb> Person.create!
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank
```

the errors are not added till the object is attempted to be stored in the db and fails validation

```bash
irb> Person.new.errors[:name].any?
=> false
irb> Person.create.errors[:name].any?
=> true
```

## validation helpers

- `acceptance`

  This method validates that a checkbox on the user interface was checked when a form was submitted. This is typically used when the user needs to agree to your application's terms of service, confirm that some text is read, or any similar concept.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: true
  end

  # custom messages can be passed using the :messages option, default: 'must be accepted'

  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: { message: 'Must be abided' }
  end

  # the :accept option detemines which values will be considered as accepted

  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: { accept: 'yes' }
    validates :eula, acceptance: { accept: ['TRUE', 'accepted'] }
  end

  # we also can pass the :reject option
  class Employee < ApplicationRecord
    validates :training, acceptance: { reject: 'no' } # accepts all things except 'no'
  end
  ```

- `validates_associated`
  
  used when model has associations with another model and the other model also needs validation,
  `validates_associated` runs validation (.`valid?`) on each of the associated objects

  - IMP_NOTE: don't use validates_associated on both models of the association otherwise they will create an infinite loop
  - default error message: "is invalid"

- `confirmation`

  two text fields should receive same input like in email or password

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, confirmation: true
  end
  ```

  this creates a virual attribute `:email_confirmation`

  this can be used in templates like so:
  
  ```erb
  <%= text_field :person, :email %>
  <%= text_field :person, :email_confirmation %>
  ```

  the check is only performed when `:email_confirmation` is not `nil`, to require the confirmation, we need to make sure that the `:email_confirmation` attribute is also not `nil`

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, confirmation: true
    validates :email_confirmation, presence: true
  end

  # there is also a case sensitive option, defults to true
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, confirmation: { case_sensitive: false }
  end
  ```

  - default error message: 'doesn't match confirmation'

- `comparision`

  creates validation b/w 2 comparable values, options must be provided, each option takes a value, symbol or proc
  class Promotion < ApplicationRecord
    validates :start_date, comparison: { greater_than: :end_date }
  end

  These options are all supported:

  - `:greater_than` - Specifies the value must be greater than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be greater than %{count}".
  - `:greater_than_or_equal_to` - Specifies the value must be greater than or equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be greater than or equal to %{count}".
  - `:equal_to` - Specifies the value must be equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be equal to %{count}".
  - `:less_than` - Specifies the value must be less than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be less than %{count}".
  - `:less_than_or_equal_to` - Specifies the value must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be less than or equal to %{count}".
  - `:other_than` - Specifies the value must be other than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be other than %{count}".
  
- `exclusion` (opp of `inclusion`)

  validates if the value is not in the given set

  ```ruby
  class Account < ApplicationRecord
    validates :subdomain, exclusion: { in: %w(www us ca jp),
      message: "%{value} is reserved." }
  end
  ```

  `:in` is also aliased as `:within`

  defult error message: 'is reserved'

- `format`
  
  validates if value matches regex given in `:with` option

  ```ruby
  class Product < ApplicationRecord
    validates :legacy_code, format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/,
      message: "only allows letters" }
  end
  ```

  also validates if value does not match regex given in `:without` option
  default error message: 'is invalid'

- `inclusion` (opp of `exclusion`)

  validates if value is in the given set

  ```ruby
  class Coffee < ApplicationRecord
    validates :size, inclusion: { in: %w(small medium large),
      message: "%{value} is not a valid size" }
  end
  ```

  `:in` is also aliased as `:within`

  defult error message: 'is not included in the list'

- `length`

  validates length of attribute

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, length: { minimum: 2, too_long: 'too long' }
    validates :bio, length: { maximum: 500, too_short: 'too short' }
    validates :password, length: { in/within: 6..20 }
    validates :registration_number, length: { is: 6, wrong_length: 'wrong length' }
  end
  ```

- `numericality`
  
  only numeric values allowed

  ```ruby
  class Player < ApplicationRecord
    validates :points, numericality: true
    validates :games_played, numericality: { only_integer: true }
  end
  ```

  if `:only_integer` is passed, then `float` values are not allowed

  Besides `:only_integer`, this helper also accepts the following options to add constraints to acceptable values:

  - `:greater_than` - Specifies the value must be greater than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be greater than %{count}".

  - `:greater_than_or_equal_to` - Specifies the value must be greater than or equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be greater than or equal to %{count}".

  - `:equal_to` - Specifies the value must be equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be equal to %{count}".

  - `:less_than` - Specifies the value must be less than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be less than %{count}".

  - `:less_than_or_equal_to` - Specifies the value must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be less than or equal to %{count}".

  - `:other_than` - Specifies the value must be other than the supplied value.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be other than %{count}".

  - `:in` - Specifies the value must be in the supplied range.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be in %{count}".

  - `:odd` - Specifies the value must be an odd number if set to true.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be odd".

  - `:even` - Specifies the value must be an even number if set to true.
    - The default error message for this option is "must be even".

  By default, numericality doesn't allow `nil` values. You can use `allow_nil:` true option to permit it.

  The default error message when no options are specified is "is not a number".

- `presence` (opp of `absence`)
  
  This helper validates that the specified attributes are not empty. It uses the `blank?` method to check if the value is either `nil` or a blank string, that is, a string that is either empty or consists of whitespace.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, :login, :email, presence: true
  end
  ```

  to verify whether an association is present, we must also verify the presence of the associated object, and not just that the foreign key exists

  ```ruby
  class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
    has_one :account
    validates :account, presence: true
  end
  ```

  - In order to validate associated records whose presence is required, you must specify the `:inverse_of option` for the association
  - If you want to ensure that the association it is both present and valid, you also need to use validates_associated.

  ```ruby
  class Order < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :line_items, inverse_of: :order
  end
  ```

   If you validate the presence of an object associated via a has_one or has_many relationship, it will check that the object is neither blank? nor marked_for_destruction?.

   now:

   ```ruby
    false.blank? #=> true
  ```

  so to check a `boolean` value, we need to use `:inclusion/:exclusion`

  ```ruby
  validates :boolean_field_name, inclusion: [true, false]
  validates :boolean_field_name, exclusion: [nil]
  default message: 'must not be blank'
  ```

- `absence` (opp of `presence`)
  
  This helper validates that the specified attributes are absent. It uses the `present?` method to check if the value is not either nil or a blank string, that is, a string that is either empty or consists of whitespace.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, :login, :email, absence: true
  end
  ```

  If you want to be sure that an association is absent, you'll need to test whether the associated object itself is absent, and not the foreign key used to map the association.

  ```ruby
  class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :order
    validates :order, absence: true
  end
  ```

  In order to validate associated records whose absence is required, you must specify the `:inverse_of` option for the association:

  ```ruby
  class Order < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :line_items, inverse_of: :order
  end
  ```

  If you validate the absence of an object associated via a `has_one` or `has_many` relationship, it will check that the object is neither `present?` nor `marked_for_destruction?`.

  Since `false.present?` is `false`, if you want to validate the absence of a `boolean` field you should use

  ```ruby
  validates :field_name, exclusion: { in: [true, false] }
  ```

  The default error message is "must be blank".

- `uniquness`
  
  checks unique constraint, since this **does not** create unique constraint on db, if our data spans different dbs, we will face a problem, so we must also uniquely index the column in the db

  ```ruby
  class Account < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, uniqueness: true
  end
  ```

  we can also check uniqueness in the scope of another column, i.e the pair of data must be unique in the table, for the reason given above, we must also define uniqueness constraints on both these columns in db

  ```ruby
  class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, uniqueness: { scope: :year,
      message: "should happen once per year" }
  end
  ```

  There is also a `:case_sensitive` option that you can use to define whether the uniqueness constraint will be case sensitive, case insensitive, or respects default database collation. This option defaults to respects default database collation.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
  end
  ```

  Note that some databases are configured to perform case-insensitive searches anyway.

  The default error message is "has already been taken".

- `validates_with`
  
  passes validation logic to a separate class

  ```ruby
  class GoodnessValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
    def validate(record)
      if record.first_name == "Evil"
        record.errors.add :base, "This person is evil"
      end
    end
  end

  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates_with GoodnessValidator
  end
  ```

  - errors added to `record.errors[:base]` are generic errors for the whole record, and not just for a particular attribute, to do that we must add to `record.errors[:attr_name]`

  Like all other validations, validates_with takes the `:if`, `:unless` and `:on` options. If you pass any other options, it will send those options to the validator class as `options`:

  ```ruby
  class GoodnessValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
    def validate(record)
      if options[:fields].any? { |field| record.send(field) == "Evil" }
        record.errors.add :base, "This person is evil"
      end
    end
  end

  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates_with GoodnessValidator, fields: [:first_name, :last_name]
  end
  ```

  **IMP_NOTE**: the validator will be initialized **only once** for the whole application life cycle, and not on each validation run, so be careful about using instance variables inside it.

  we can pass an object to the instance of validator class, we can also make new instances if we want to use instance variables

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validate do |person|
      GoodnessValidator.new(person).validate
    end
  end

  class GoodnessValidator
    def initialize(person)
      @person = person
    end

    def validate
      if some_complex_condition_involving_ivars_and_private_methods?
        @person.errors.add :base, "This person is evil"
      end
    end

    # ...
  end
  ```

- `validates_each`
  
  validates attributes against given block, does not have a predefined validation function

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates_each :name, :surname do |record, attr, value|
      record.errors.add(attr, 'must start with upper case') if value =~ /\A[[:lower:]]/
    end
  end
  ```

## common validation options

- `:allow_nil`

  The :allow_nil option skips the validation when the value being validated is nil.

  ```ruby
  class Coffee < ApplicationRecord
    validates :size, inclusion: { in: %w(small medium large),
      message: "%{value} is not a valid size" }, allow_nil: true
  end
  ```

- `:allow blank`

  The :allow_blank option is similar to the :allow_nil option. This option will let validation pass if the attribute's value is blank?, like nil or an empty string for example.

  ```ruby
  class Topic < ApplicationRecord
    validates :title, length: { is: 5 }, allow_blank: true
  end
  ```

  ```bash
  irb> Topic.create(title: "").valid?
  => true
  irb> Topic.create(title: nil).valid?
  => true
  ```

- `:message`

  the `:message` option allows you to specify what error message to be displayed, when not used, `ActiveRecord` uses the default message, the error message can be specified using a `Proc` or `String`

  - A String `:message` value can optionally contain any/all of `%{value}`, `%{attribute}`, and `%{model}` which will be dynamically replaced when validation fails. This replacement is done using the `I18n` gem, and the placeholders must match exactly, no spaces are allowed.

    - this interpolation has **%{},** not **#{}**

  - A Proc :message value is given two arguments: the object being validated, and a hash with :model, :attribute, and :value key-value pairs.
  
  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    # Hard-coded message

    validates :name, presence: { message: "must be given please" }

    # Message with dynamic attribute value. %{value} will be replaced
    # with the actual value of the attribute. %{attribute} and %{model}
    # are also available.

    validates :age, numericality: { message: "%{value} seems wrong" }

    # Proc
    validates :username,
      uniqueness: {
        # object = person object being validated
        # data = { model: "Person", attribute: "Username", value: <username> }
        message: ->(object, data) do
          "Hey #{object.name}, #{data[:value]} is already taken."
        end
      }
  end
  ```

- `on`

  lets you specify when the validation should occur

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    # it will be possible to update email with a duplicated value
    validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :create

    # it will be possible to create the record with a non-numerical age
    validates :age, numericality: true, on: :update

    # the default (validates on both create and update)
    validates :name, presence: true
  end
  ```

  You can also use `on:` to define custom contexts. Custom contexts need to be triggered explicitly by passing the name of the context to `valid?`, `invalid?`, or `save`.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :account_setup
    validates :age, numericality: true, on: :account_setup
  end
  ```

  ```bash
  irb> person = Person.new(age: 'thirty-three')
  irb> person.valid?
  => true
  irb> person.valid?(:account_setup)
  => false
  irb> person.errors.messages
  => {:email=>["has already been taken"], :age=>["is not a number"]}
  ```

  `person.valid?(:account_setup)` executes both the validations without saving the model.
  
  `person.save(context: :account_setup)` validates person in the account_setup context before saving.

  When triggered by an explicit context, validations are run for that context, as well as any validations without a context.

  ```ruby
  class Person < ApplicationRecord
    validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :account_setup
    validates :age, numericality: true, on: :account_setup
    validates :name, presence: true
  end
  ```

  ```bash
  irb> person = Person.new
  irb> person.valid?(:account_setup)
  => false
  irb> person.errors.messages
  => {:email=>["has already been taken"], :age=>["is not a number"], :name=>["can't be blank"]}
  ```

## Strict Validations

always throw error when invalid regardless of bang methods

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: { strict: true }
end
```

```bash
irb> Person.new.valid?
ActiveModel::StrictValidationFailed: Name can't be blank
```

we can also pass custom error to :strict

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :token, presence: true, uniqueness: true, strict: TokenGenerationException
end
```

```bash
irb> Person.new.valid?
TokenGenerationException: Token can't be blank
```

## conditional validation

when we want to validate on some previous unrelated conditions, we use :if, :unless predicates to check for conditions

- using a symbol with predicates
  
  ```ruby
  class Order < ApplicationRecord
    validates :card_number, presence: true, if: :paid_with_card?

    def paid_with_card?
      payment_type == "card"
    end
  end
  ```

- using a Proc
  
  ```ruby
  class Account < ApplicationRecord
    validates :password, confirmation: true,
      unless: Proc.new { |a| a.password.blank? }
  end
  ```

  note that we can use labmda here as well

- grouping conditional validations (different from grouping conditionals)
  
  ```ruby
  class User < ApplicationRecord
    with_options if: :is_admin? do |admin|
      admin.validates :password, length: { minimum: 10 }
      admin.validates :email, presence: true
    end
  end
  ```

  here the `with_options` method performs the validations inside the block if the `:is_admin condition`

- grouping conditionals (different from grouping conditional validations)

  - we can use an `Array` of conditionals in an :`if/:unless` option, we can also add `:if` and `:unless` to the same validation

  - The validation only runs when all the `:if` conditions and none of the `:unless` conditions are evaluated to `true`.

## performing custom validations

to make a custom validator, you must inherit the custom validator class from `ActiveModel::Validator`, `ActiveModel::Validator` expects a `validate(record)` method to be implemented in the class (with the record to be validated passed as the argument), the custom validator is called using the `validates_with` method

```ruby
class MyValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
  def validate(record)
    unless record.name.start_with? 'X'
      record.errors.add :name, "Need a name starting with X please!"
    end
  end
end

class Person
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  validates_with MyValidator
end
```

this can only be run for the full record and the full record is passed into the validator

if we want to check only one attribute of a record, we can inherit from `ActiveModel::EachValidator`, which expects the custom class to implement a `validate_each(record, attribute, value)`, These arguments correspond to the instance, the attribute to be validated, and the value of the attribute in the passed instance.

```ruby
class EmailValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
    unless value =~ /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/i
      record.errors.add attribute, (options[:message] || "is not an email")
    end
  end
end

class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, email: true
end
```

we can combine standard validators with our custom validators

## custom validation methods

You can also create methods that verify the state of your models and add errors to the errors collection when they are invalid. You must then register these methods by using the validate class method, passing in the symbols for the validation methods' names.

You can pass more than one symbol for each class method and the respective validations will be run in the same order as they were registered.

The `valid?` method will verify that the errors collection is empty, so your custom validation methods should add errors to it when you wish validation to fail:

```ruby
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
  validate :expiration_date_cannot_be_in_the_past,
    :discount_cannot_be_greater_than_total_value

  def expiration_date_cannot_be_in_the_past
    if expiration_date.present? && expiration_date < Date.today
      errors.add(:expiration_date, "can't be in the past")
    end
  end

  def discount_cannot_be_greater_than_total_value
    if discount > total_value
      errors.add(:discount, "can't be greater than total value")
    end
  end
end
```

By default, such validations will run every time you call `valid?` or save the object. But it is also possible to control when to run these custom validations by giving an :on option to the validate method, with either: `:create` or `:update`.

```ruby
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
  validate :active_customer, on: :create

  def active_customer
    errors.add(:customer_id, "is not active") unless customer.active?
  end
end
```

## Working with validation errors

an ApplicationRecord inheriting class

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

we can create an object of this class

```ruby
p = Person.new

p.valid? #=> false
```

the full error object of type `ActiveModel::Errors`

```ruby
p.errors #=> ["Name can't be blank", "Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]
```

```bash
irb> person = Person.new(name: "John Doe")
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.errors.full_messages
=> []
```

`errors[:attr_name]` is used to check the errors for a specific attribute

```bash
irb> person = Person.new(name: "JD")
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors[:name]
=> ["is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]
irb> person.errors[:age]
=> []


irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false

irb> person.errors.where(:name)
=> [ ... ] # all errors for :name attribute

irb> person.errors.where(:name, :too_short)
=> [ ... ] # :too_short errors for :name attribute
```

You can read various information from these error objects:

```bash
irb> error = person.errors.where(:name).last

irb> error.attribute
=> :name
irb> error.type
=> :too_short
irb> error.options[:count]
=> 3
```

You can also generate the error message:

```bash
irb> error.message
=> "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
irb> error.full_message
=> "Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
```

The `full_message` method generates a more user-friendly message, with the capitalized attribute name prepended.

The `add` method creates the error object by taking the attribute, the error type and additional options hash. This is useful for writing your own validator.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validate do |person|
    errors.add :name, :too_plain, message: "is not cool enough"
  end
end
```

```bash
irb> person = Person.create
irb> person.errors.where(:name).first.type
=> :too_plain

irb> person.errors.where(:name).first.full_message
=> "Name is not cool enough"
```

You can add errors that are related to the object's state as a whole, instead of being related to a specific attribute. You can add errors to `:base` when you want to say that the object is invalid, no matter the values of its attributes.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validate do |person|
    errors.add :base, :invalid, message: "This person is invalid because ..."
  end
end
```

```bash
irb> person = Person.create
irb> person.errors.where(:base).first.full_message
=> "This person is invalid because ..."
```

The `clear` method is used when you intentionally want to clear the errors collection. Of course, calling errors.clear upon an invalid object won't actually make it valid, the errors collection will now be empty, but the next time you call valid? or any method that tries to save this object to the database, the validations will run again. If any of the validations fail, the errors collection will be filled again.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

```bash
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.empty?
=> false

irb> person.errors.clear
irb> person.errors.empty?
=> true

irb> person.save
=> false

irb> person.errors.empty?
=> false
```

The `size` method returns the total number of errors for the object.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

```bash
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.size
=> 2

irb> person = Person.new(name: "Andrea", email: "andrea@example.com")
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.errors.size
=> 0
```
